This project is the Day-28  course project of [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Aangela Yu.

Mostly the main feature and the material is from the course. I only make some tiny tweaks on the bottom of the work session counts mark. I used the windows emoji icons to mark the completed pomodoro sessions.

This short video records a simply short version to demonstrate how it works of each session count to 00:00.

In the working version I set the work time to 25 minutes, short-break for 5 minutes, and long-break for 30 minutes.
